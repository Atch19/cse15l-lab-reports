## Trying some commands
* You should try to run a few commands. You can find most on the web but, here are a few examples: cd {dir}, ls, pwd, mkdir {name}, and cp.
* You can try to log out and run a few of those commands again, on your local pc, just to get to know your environment.   

Here is a sample of the mkdir and ls command.

## Moving Files with `scp`
* Scp is used to safely transfer files between different computers. 
* To start off lets create a java file with some code.

For Example we can have:

```
class WhereAmI{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("I am using a " + System.getProperty("os.name") + " Operating system. ");
    }
}
```
* Save the file, then run `scp WhereAmI.java (Username)@ieng6.ucsd.edu:~/`
* This command will transfer your file to the remote ieng6 computer after you type in the password when promoted. 

This should be what you see:

* After you log in, try running `ls` to see if your file was actually transfered.

You should get a simular output:

## Setting a SSH Key
* SSH keys are useful to assist with logging in and out of servers without using your password which can be tiresome. 
* This process will create a pair of private and public keys which will help you log in faster. 
* Type in `ssh-keygen`.
* When prompted to enter a file in which to save your key type

`/Users/(local username)/.ssh/id_rsa`

* Leave the passphrase blank once prompted.

* You will now pass the key on to the server. ssh to the server once again. 
* Once on the server you will type `mkdir .ssh`
* Log out 
* Type in `scp /Users/(local username)/.ssh/id_rsa.pub (username)@ieng6.ucsd.edu:~/.ssh/authorized_keys`


If everything went smoothly, this is what you should see.

Notice how I am not prompted to enter my password. 
## Optimizing Remote Running
* You can now run commands from  your local computer to the remote computer. Try `ssh (username)@ieng6.ucsd.edu "ls"`
* It will quickly log into the server and run the command and then log out, printing the output in the terminal. 
* To run several commands at once, add a `;` between commands. 

This is an example of running several commands, it `scp` the command into the remote server, complies it using javac, then runs it using java.
